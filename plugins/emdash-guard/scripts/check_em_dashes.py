"""Flag em dashes and the look-alikes people use to smuggle the same pause back in.

Vendored from https://github.com/exmergo/skill-no-em-dashes (MIT). See ../NOTICE.

Usage:
    python check_em_dashes.py path/to/draft.txt
    echo "Your text here" | python check_em_dashes.py

Reads from the file arguments if given, otherwise from stdin. Prints every hit
with its line and column and a short suggested fix, then exits 1 if anything was
found and 0 if the text is clean.

The goal is to catch dashes doing the work of sentence punctuation, not to
"correct" legitimate hyphens. The checker therefore leaves alone:
  - hyphenated compounds (well-known, state-of-the-art, mother-in-law)
  - number, date, and score ranges (10-20, 2019-2024, a 3-1 win)
  - hyphens inside code spans, fenced code blocks, and URLs
  - minus signs in arithmetic (5 - 3)
  - list markers at the start of a line ("- item")
  - markdown structure: front matter delimiters and horizontal rules (a line of
    three or more hyphens) and table separator rows (| --- | --- |)
